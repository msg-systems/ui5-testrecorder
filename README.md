# UI5 Test Recorder

The *UI5 Test Recorder* enables efficient test automation for SAP UI5 and OpenUI5 applications, by enabling the user to record test scenarios with only simple tools.
To this end, the UI5 test recorder provides export capabilities to UIVeri5, TestCafe, and OPA5.
While recording, the tool supports you in setting the perfect combination of unique attributes to allow a stable and reproducible test execution.
