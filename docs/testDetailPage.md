## The test-detail page

### The test-settings tab

The first part of the test-details page is the tab `Test Settings` showing you some general information on the selected test:
- the *test category*,
- the *test name*,
- the *test page*, which contains the URL of the application page, and
- the *UI5 version* of the application page.

At the center of the page, you can find a list of all test steps that have been recorded.

You can *replay* these steps by clicking the button `Start replay` in the table toolbar.
The interval between subsequent test steps can be selected
using the dropdown menu to the left of the replay button:
- *Manual*: Each test step has to be executed manually by using corresponding buttons.
- *Slow*: The replay executes automatically, with 2 seconds among test steps.
- *Medium*: The replay executes automatically, with 1 seconds among test steps.
- *Fast*: The replay executes automatically, with 0.5 seconds among test steps.

In the footer at the bottom of the page, you find some buttons, for example, to save the test, to (re-)start recording, and to export the test.
